What are the pros and cons of TDD?

Pros of Test Driven Development:

Some of the benefits of TDD include as you are writing small tests at a time, it forces your code to be more modular. TDD helps you learn, understand, and internalise the key principles of good modular design. TDD also forces good architecture. In order to make your code unit-testable, it must be properly modularized. In addition, it makes code easier to maintain and refactor. TDD helps to provide clarity during the implementation process and provides a safety-net when you want to refactor the code youâ€™ve just written. Finally it makes collaboration easier and more efficient and helps prevents defects - well, at least it helps you find design or requirement issues right at the beginning. 

Cons of Test Driven Development:

Some cons of TDD include that it initially at the beginning of your project slows down development as you spend time writing tests first. The tests also have to be maintained and updated throughout the process. Also, unless everyone on the team correctly maintains their tests, the whole system can quickly degrade. Finally, it can be difficuly to adopt and learn how to correctly and efficiently write tests, which might make people not want to do so, and the whole team has to be onboard with this idea.
